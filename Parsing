Tasks:
1 - `cat` file ‘/etc/default/useradd’ and grep lines not started with ‘#’ and skip
empty lines as well. The construction should be: `cat /etc/default/useradd
| grep ... | grep ...`.

cat /etc/default/useradd | grep -v '^#' | grep -v '^$'

2 - Grep in file ‘/etc/default/useradd’ lines not started with ‘#’ and skip empty
lines as well. Do it with only one grep command.

grep -v '^#\|^$' /etc/default/useradd

3 - awk
    1. Get the list of the processes
    2. Grep 'sshd -D' from it (you must have ssh server running on your host).
You should get only one string (add additional step into your pipe)
    3. Using `awk` get the path to executable file
    4. Perform all steps in one pipe
    
ps aux   | grep 'sshd -D'|       head -1      | awk '{print $11}'

процессы | шаблон поиска | только 1-ую строку | получение исполняемого пути
    
    
d) cut
    1. Using `date` command without any keys get the data
    2. With `cut` command get the time
    3. Perform in one pipe
    
date | cut -d ' ' -f 5
